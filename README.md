# Muscle-Electrophysiology-Data-Analysis
* This is a course project created in MATLAB. It analyzes and extracts data gained from the stimulation and activity of the arm muscle. Specifically, the 3rd motor point on the Flexor Digitorun Superficialis (FDS) corresponding to the middle finger and the Flexor Carpi Ulnaris (FCU) muscle, respectively. Then extracting the:
  * Raw trial-sorted and trial-averaged force profiles
  * Twich parameters vs stimulation amplitude
  * Twitch parameters vs stimulation frequency
  * RAW EMG amplitude, EMG RMS and frequency bands (100-200, 200-300, 300-400 Hz) vs grip force

* Last updated on: 4th Feb 2025, as Lab 3 for the course BIOEN 566 - Neural Engineering Lab.

* This program was written in MATLAB. To run, import files to local system and run on MATLAB IDE or preferred text editor which can run MATLAB files (Recommended: VSCode).
